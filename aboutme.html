        <p>First of all, welcome to my website! Thank you for visiting. My name is Taehun Lee, a student attending University of Alberta studying Computing Science.
            I am very passionate about computing science and also its related fields such as graphic design, 3D modelling, image and video processing. Aside from
            my skills in computing science, I am very fluent in Korean and have experiences aiding others with my lingual skills; volunteering at a Korean health fare
            or working as TA in my university's Korean lectures are one of many instances where I was able to demonstrate my Korean skills. In addition, I am also able to speak basic level of
            Chinese. My competency to work in a group is demonstrated through my volunteering experience as translator and TA, which were mentioned above, as both experiences
            required me to work with group of other individuals. Not to mention my extracurriculars before post secondary, such as robotics team and air cadets, further highlight
            teamwork and my competency in communication.
